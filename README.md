### Profile

I am an applied technologist with experience in **software engineering, computer graphics, and embedded systems**.  

My work merges low-level computation with user-centered design to create scalable, efficient, and perceptually intelligent systems.



Currently part of the **VEX Robotics Development Team** at ITSOEH, where I specialize in **control programming, data flow optimization, and hardware–software integration**.  

I am particularly interested in how **AI, IoT, and spatial computing** converge to shape the next generation of intelligent environments.
