### Profile

I am an applied technologist with experience in **software engineering, computer graphics, and embedded systems**.  

My work merges low-level computation with user-centered design to create scalable, efficient, and perceptually intelligent systems.



Currently part of the **VEX Robotics Team** at ITSOEH, where I specialize in **control programming, data flow optimization, and hardware–software integration**.  

I am particularly interested in how **AI, IoT, and spatial computing** converge to shape the next generation of intelligent environments.

### Research

Research collaborator at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (Xi'an Jiaotong–Liverpool University · 西交利物浦大学, Suzhou, China)**

Contributing to applied research in intelligent systems, multimodal AI architectures, and hardware-aware optimization for real-world deployment.

**Research Areas:**

- Multimodal Vision-Language inference pipelines  
- Edge AI acceleration (ONNX / TensorRT optimization)  
- Robotics control intelligence and embedded computation  
- Human–machine interaction modeling  
- Health-oriented robotic arm diagnostics (Arm Health AI)  
- Scalable distributed AI system design  

My research integrates machine learning, real-time systems, and embedded architectures to develop production-grade intelligent systems with measurable performance constraints (latency, throughput, and hardware efficiency).
